    <h2>Welcome to Backbone JS</h2>
    <p>Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and
        custom
        events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling,
        and
        connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a></p>
